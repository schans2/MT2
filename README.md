## More Thinking About Technologies & UI/UX (1/27/22)
I am now quite interested in using [this NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-audio-daw) for the sort of web instrument / DAW I want to make. My goal with this project is to implement as many DAW-like features as I can in the time I have on top of multiple playable or sequenceable virtual instruments. As such, I think this module will take a lot of the legwork out of implementing features I was worried about being complex, such as recording. Other notable links I want to put here are things that the module's page recommends for extended functionality, such as [these impulse responses for reverb](https://www.voxengo.com/impulses/) and [Tuna](https://github.com/Theodeus/tuna/wiki#the-nodes), a Web Audio effects library. Also here's some [Web Audio API documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Using_Web_Audio_API), because why not?

Regarding user interface, I am thinking about having the sequencing GUI resemble [Google Song Maker](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/), where you can click or touch the screen to input notes / drum patterns. Differences over this specifically I want to implement include having the grid to support up to 32nd notes, having some kind of triplet support, and having alternate time signature support (at least 3/4, 4/4, and 5/4, since you can extrapolate a good amount from these, but hopefully more uncommon ones too). As for the general "vibe" of the GUI, I am planning on going with the same black and rainbow aesthetic as my Music & Tech 1 final project, pictured. ![The Instant Dance Party](/assets/blog/ScreenshotIDP.png "The Instant Dance Party")

## About (1/13/22)
This blog is for a class I am currently taking: Music and Technology II. I hope it will fully and accurately convey whatever the timeline ends up being for this project's formation. For now, though, the creation of this blog certainly is a first step in that direction. As for project ideas, right now I'm thinking that I want to build a web-interface instrument of some kind. The term "instrument" might be just a bit disingenuous, though, as I'm imagining something you could play a full, multi-faceted song on. Going forward, I'll be thinking a lot about what sort of control sceme I should set up. Should the user perhaps be able to pre-program some kind of sequence for a bass and drum pattern and then play the lead, for instance? Or should there be multiple, simultaneously controllable timbres for the user? These are the kinds of things I'll be thinking about going forward.
